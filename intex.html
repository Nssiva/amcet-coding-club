    <p>Chainsaw Man (Japanese: „ÉÅ„Çß„É≥„ÇΩ„Éº„Éû„É≥, Hepburn: Chens≈ç Man) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

        Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished young man who makes a contract that fuses his body with that of a dog-like devil named Pochita, granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting against devils whenever they become a threat to Japan. The second arc of the story focuses on Asa Mitaka, a high school student who enters into a contract with Yoru, the War Devil, who forces her to hunt down Chainsaw Man in order to reclaim the devils stolen from her.
        
        In North America, the manga is licensed in English by Viz Media, for both print and digital release, and it is also published by Shueisha on the Manga Plus online platform. An anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA was broadcast from October to December 2022.

<p>Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a Devil-human Hybrid, under the condition that Denji live out his modest dreams of living a basic life such as having bread with jam, or falling in love with a woman and being intimate with one. By pulling on a cord in his chest, Denji then becomes Chainsaw Man and massacres the yakuza.

    In the aftermath, Denji joins a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, who assigns him to kill the Gun Devil. After being paired with a more experienced Devil Hunter named Aki Hayakawa, Denji begins training with his partner, Power the Blood Fiend, under the veteran Devil Hunter Kishibe. Together, they fight several enemies who seek Denji's power, including the yakuza, other Devils, and assassins sent by various countries.
    
    Makima is later revealed to be the Control Devil, who is ultimately seeking to control Pochita, as he has the power to erase evil concepts from the world by consuming their Devils. The Gun Devil‚Äîwhose body had secretly been divided among several countries as a superweapon‚Äîis sent by the United States to kill Makima, but she defeats it, forcing it to enter Aki's body as the Gun Fiend, whom Denji kills in self-defense. Makima later kills Power in front of Denji, rendering him catatonic and forcing Pochita to take over his body.
    
    Kishibe organizes a raid to rescue Denji alongside cowardly Public Safety operative Kobeni Higashiyama. With their help and the last of Power's blood, Denji kills Makima. Some time later, Kishibe places the reborn Control Devil‚Äîa little girl named Nayuta‚Äîin Denji's care. In a dream, Pochita thanks Denji for showing him his dreams, and encourages him to live his life to the fullest. Denji begins attending high school while also fighting Devils as a vigilante.

    <p>Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by Pochita, his canine companion. Denji is betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the condition that Denji shows his dreams to Pochita. Denji kills the Zombie Devil and massacres the yakuza, and is approached by a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public Safety Division, led by Makima, the first person to be kind to him, who hugs him after he asks her to do so and persuades him to join their ranks. Agreeing, Denji is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend, and Aki Hayakawa, a self-destructive Devil Hunter. After showing him how to connect with someone on a deeper level, and asking him to always remember her bite on his finger "even if he goes blind" Makima promises Denji any favor, provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of the greatest massacre in human history.[11]
        Critics enjoyed the handling of Denji's interest of sex; several further praised how the writing helps to make the platonic relationship between Denji and Power feel genuine contrasting his deeper attraction with Makima.[24][25][26] Comic Book Resources saw him as a seemingly unique Devil Hunter due to his simplicity, his relationship with his teammates and ambiguous last moments with Pochita who saves him from death in his debut.[27] Reviewing the series' 97th and last chapter published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, Reiichi Narima of Real Sound commented that Denji's growth through loss is a storytelling more related to seinen manga than sh≈çnen manga, adding that he was "deeply moved" by the inclusion of this kind of stories in the magazine, ultimately calling it a masterpiece and concluding: "at the core of bloody violence, there was a boy's sad love story."[28] For the series' second story arc, Siliconera saw several parallels between Denji and the new protagonist Asa due to their connections with devils, as well as upbringing.[29] Comic Book Resources did not notice major changes within Denji's characterization after several chapters and found it unsetting how his bond with Power seemingly faded as the protagonist only cares about becoming popular rather than searching a devil.[30]
        
        In a popularity poll of the manga, Denji took second place behind Power.[31] In another poll, he took fourth place.[32] Denji also inspired several cosplays according to IGN.[33] In one such cosplay, Denji's hybrid form was replicated with props resembling revving chainsaws.[34]</p>
