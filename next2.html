<p>Denji is ambushed at a warehouse when he goes on a job to kill devils (Chainsaw Man's version of demons). It turns out the contractor is a devil in disguise, and he's turned a ton of hunters like Denji into devils, too. They maim Denji, but he bonds with his dog, Pochita, who transfers its devil powers to him. Denji then officially comes the Chainsaw Man, slaughtering all the goons around.

    This leads to Makima finding and hugging him, and asking him to be part of the Public Safety initiative. She tells her companions she knows when someone's possessed, and he's not -- showing affection and genuine care. Clearly, she has a crush, although it's not certain if it's because Denji's such a good killer, or if she thinks he's cute and worth saving. Denji eventually enlists, just wanting food, payment and a roof over his head.</p>

<p>Makima had always underestimated Denji and was obsessed with the Chainsaw devil within him. This obsession with Pochita led her to drop her guard and let the actual Denji defeat her by shredding her with a chainsaw he managed to create out of the blood contract he had made with Power.</p>
